Arithmetic
The Sass arithmetic operations are:
1. addition +
2. subtraction -
3. multiplication *
4. division /, and 
5. modulo %. 

SCSS arithmetic requires that the units are compatible; for example, you can't multiply pixels by ems.

Also, just like in regular math, multiplying two units together results in squared units:10px * 10px = 100px * px. 
Since there is no such thing as squared units in CSS, the above would throw an error.
You would need to multiply 10px * 10 in order to obtain 100px.
