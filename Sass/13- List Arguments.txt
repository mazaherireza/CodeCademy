List Arguments
Sass allows you to pass in multiple arguments in a list or a map format.
..., take the multiple properties needed to create the college-ruled stripes in the back of our notecard. 

@mixin stripes($direction, $width-percent, $stripe-color, $stripe-background: #FFF) {
  background: repeating-linear-gradient(
    $direction,
    $stripe-background,
    $stripe-background ($width-percent - 1),
    $stripe-color 1%,
    $stripe-background $width-percent
  );
}

In this scenario, it makes sense to create a map with these properties 
in case we ever want to update or reference them.

$college-ruled-style: ( 
  direction: to bottom,
  width-percent: 15%,
  stripe-color: blue,
  stripe-background: white
);

When we include our mixin, we can then pass in these arguments in a map with the following ... notation:

.definition {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  @include stripes($college-ruled-style...); <-------------- **
}

Remember to always prioritize readability over writing less code. 
This approach is only useful if you find it adds clarity to your codebase.
