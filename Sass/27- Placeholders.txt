%Placeholders
Sometimes, you may create classes solely for the purpose of extending them and 
never actually use them inside your HTML. <------------------ **
Sass anticipated this and allows for a special type of selector called a placeholder, 
which behaves just like a class or id selector, but uses the % notation instead of # or . <------------ **

Placeholders prevent rules from being rendered to CSS on their own and 
only become active once they are extended anywhere an id or class could be extended.

a%drink {
  font-size: 2em;
  background-color: $lemon-yellow;
}

.lemonade {
  @extend %drink; <------------ **
  //more rules
}

would translate to

a.lemonade {
  font-size: 2em;
  background-color: $lemon-yellow;
}

.lemonade {
  //more rules
}

Placeholders are a nice way to consolidate rules that never actually get used on their own in the HTML.
