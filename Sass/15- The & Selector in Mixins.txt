The & Selector in Mixins
...
Sass allows & selector usage inside of mixins. 

The flow works much like you think it would: 
1. The & selector gets assigned the value of the parent at the point where the mixin is included. <------- **
2. If there is no parent selector, then the value is null and Sass will throw an error.

@mixin text-hover($color) {
  &:hover {
    color: $color; 
  }
}

In the above, the value of the parent selector will be assigned 
based on the parent at the point where it is invoked.

.word {
  display: block; 
  text-align: center;
  position: relative;
  top: 40%;
  @include text-hover(red); <---------------- **
}

The above will compile the following CSS:

.word { 
  display: block;
  text-align: center;
  position: relative;
  top: 40%;
}

.word:hover {
  color: red;
}

... the mixin inherited the parent selector word 
because that was the parent at the point where the mixin was included. <----------- **
