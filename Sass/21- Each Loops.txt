Each Loops
... iterate on each of the values on a list. 
The syntax is as follows:

@each $item in $list {}

The value of $item is dynamically assigned to the value of the object in the list 
according to its position and the iteration of the loop.

$list: (orange, purple, teal);

@each $item in $list {
  .#{$item} {
    background: $item;
  }
}
