Color Functions
Sass also allows us to perform mathematical functions to compute measurements, including colors.
Here is how Sass computes colors:

1. The operation is performed on the red, green, and blue components. 
2. It computes the answer by operating on every two digits. 

$color: #010203 + #040506;

The above would compute piece-wise as follows:

01 + 04 = 05
02 + 05 = 07
03 + 06 = 09

and compile to: color: #050709;

Sass arithmetic can also compute HSLA and string colors such as red and blue. <------------ **
