Nesting Properties
In SCSS, nesting is not limited only to selectors. 
You can also nest common CSS properties if you append a : colon suffix after the name of the property. 
For example, the following SCSS code:

.parent {
  font: { <---------------- **
    family: Roboto, sans-serif;
    size: 12px;
    decoration: none;
  }
}

will compile to the following CSS:

.parent {
  font-family: Roboto, sans-serif;
  font-size: 12px;
  font-decoration: none;
}
