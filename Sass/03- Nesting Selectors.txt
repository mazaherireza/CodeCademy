Nesting Selectors
Nesting is the process of placing selectors inside the scope of another selector:
... it's helpful to think of the scope of a selector 
as any of the code between its opening { and closing } curly brackets.

Selectors that are nested inside the scope of another selector are referred to as children.
The former selector is referred to as the parent.
This is just like the relationship observed in HTML elements.

.parent {
  color: blue;
  .child {
    font-size: 12px;
  }
}

The above SCSS would compile to the following, equivalent CSS:

.parent {
  color: blue;
}
.parent .child {
  font-size: 12px;
}

Nesting allows you to see the clear DOM relationship between two selectors 
while also removing the repetition observed in CSS.

With Sass, you can avoid repeating the parent over and over again 
and also avoid definining each selector independently.
