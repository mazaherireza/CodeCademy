For Loops
... can be used to style numerous elements or assigning properties all at once. 
They work like any for-loop you've seen before.

Sass's for loop syntax is as follows:

@for $i from $begin through $end {}

In the example above:
1. $i is just a variable for the index, or position of the element in the list.
2. $begin and $end are placeholders for the start and end points of the loop. 
3. The keywords through and to are interchangeable in Sass.<-------------- **

$total: 10; <---------- Number of .ray divs in our html
$step: 360deg / $total; <------------- Used to compute the hue based on color-wheel

.ray {
  height: 30px;
}

@for $i from 1 through $total {
  .ray:nth-child(#{$i}) {
    background: adjust-hue(blue, $i * $step);
   }
}
