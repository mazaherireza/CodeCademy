Arithmetic and Color
..., Sass specifically comes equipped with functions that make working with colors easier.

The alpha parameter in a color like RGBA or HSLA is a mask denoting opacity. 
It specifies how one color should be merged with another when the two are on top of each other. <--------- **

In Sass, the function fade-out makes a color more transparent 
by taking a number between 0 and 1, and decreasing opacity or the alpha channel, by that amount:

$color: rgba(39, 39, 39, 0.5);
$amount: 0.1;
$color2: fade-out($color, $amount); //rgba(39, 39, 39, 0.4)

The fade-in color function changes a color by increasing its opacity:

$color: rgba(55,7,56, 0.5);
$amount: 0.1;
$color2: fade-in($color, $amount); //rgba(55,7,56, 0.6)

The function adjust-hue($color, $degrees) changes the hue of a color 
by taking color and a number of degrees (usually between -360 degrees and 360 degrees), 
and rotate the color wheel by that amount.
