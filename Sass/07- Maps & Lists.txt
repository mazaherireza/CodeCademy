Maps & Lists
In addition to colors, numbers, strings, booleans, and null, 
Sass also has two other data types, lists and maps.<-------------- **

Lists can be separated by either spaces or commas. 
For example, the following list denotes font properties, such as: 
1.5em Helvetica bold;
or 
Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;

You can also surround a list with parentheses and create lists made up of lists.

Maps are very similar to lists, but instead each object is a key-value pair. 
The typical map looks like:
(key1: value1, key2: value2);

In a map, the value of a key can be a list or another map.
