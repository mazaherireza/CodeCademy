Mixin: Arguments
Mixins also have the ability to take in a value. 
An argument, or parameter, is a value passed to the mixin 
that will be used inside the mixin, such as $visibility in this example:

@mixin backface-visibility($visibility) {
  backface-visibility: $visibility;
  -webkit-backface-visibility: $visibility;
  -moz-backface-visibility: $visibility;
  -ms-backface-visibility: $visibility;
  -o-backface-visibility: $visibility;
}

The syntax to pass in a value is as follows:
@include backface-visibility(hidden);

..., hidden is passed in to the backface-visibility mixin, 
where it will be assigned as the value of its argument, $visibility.
