Conditionals
In Sass, if() is a function that can only branch one of two ways based on a condition. 
You can use it inline, to assign the value of a property:
width: if( $condition, $value-if-true, $value-if-false); <-------------- **

For cases with more than two outcomes, 
the @if, @else-if, and @else directives allow for more flexibility.

@mixin deck($suit) {
 @if($suit == hearts || $suit == spades) {
   color: blue;
 }
 @else-if($suit == clovers || $suit == diamonds) {
   color: red;
 }
 @else{
   <------------ some rule
 }
}
