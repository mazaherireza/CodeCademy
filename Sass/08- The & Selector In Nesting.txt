The & Selector in Nesting
..., in CSS, a pseudo-element is used to style parts of an element, for example:
Styling the content ::before or ::after the content of an element.

Using a pseudo class such as :hover to set the properties of an element 
when the user's mouse is touching the area of the element. 

In Sass, the & character is used to specify exactly where a parent selector should be inserted. 
It also helps write psuedo classes in a much less repetitive way.
For example, the following Sass:

.notecard { 
  &:hover { <------------------ **
      @include transform (rotatey(-180deg));  
  }
}

will compile to the following CSS:

.notecard:hover {
  transform: rotatey(-180deg);
}
