Organize with Partials
... are the files you split up to organize specific functionality in the codebase. <------------- **
They use a _ prefix notation in the file name that tells Sass 
to hold off on compiling the file individually and instead use it.
_filename.scss

To use this partial into the main file, 
or the file that encapsulates the use rules and the bulk of the project styles, omit the underscore. 
For example, to use a file named _variables.scss, add the following line of code:
@use "variables";

The global file uses all the components and centralizes the logic.
